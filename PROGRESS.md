# Implementation Progress
Each entry tracks the current stage of the thread-limit feature, using emoji to show status and a rough completion percentage.

1. ✅ **33%** – Inspected bootstrap/state and UI wiring to determine where RAYON thread control belongs.
2. ✅ **67%** – Implemented backend persistence, commands, and startup hook so the app respects saved thread limits.
3. ✅ **100%** – Updated the settings UI, persisted progress markers, and verified the new controls (formatting pass).
