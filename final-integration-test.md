# Final Integration Test

This file tests both issues have been resolved:
1. CodeMirror integration is working
2. No "preserve" placeholders appear in the output

## CodeMirror Test

### JavaScript Code Block
```javascript
// This should render with CodeMirror, not as "preserve"
function testCodeMirror() {
    console.log("CodeMirror should work!");
    const pytorch = "this should not be enhanced";
    return pytorch;
}
```

### Python Code Block
```python
# Python code should also work with CodeMirror
def test_python():
    tensorflow = "should not be enhanced inside code"
    print(f"Testing: {tensorflow}")
    return True
```

### CSS Code Block
```css
/* CSS should work */
.test-class {
    background: var(--bg-color);
    color: var(--text-color);
}
```

## Technical Terms Enhancement Test

The following technical terms should be enhanced outside code blocks:
- pytorch should become `pytorch`
- tensorflow should become `tensorflow`
- javascript should become `javascript`
- python should become `python`
- json should become `json`

### Mixed Content Test

Here's a sentence with `inline code containing pytorch` and regular pytorch outside.

In this paragraph, we mention pytorch and tensorflow as technical terms that should be enhanced, but inside the `code block with pytorch` they should remain unchanged.

### Multi-line Code Block with Technical Terms

```json
{
  "model": "pytorch model",
  "framework": "tensorflow",
  "language": "python",
  "data_format": "json"
}
```

After the code block, pytorch and tensorflow should be enhanced again.

## Expected Results

✅ **CodeMirror Integration:**
- All code blocks should render with interactive CodeMirror editors
- Each code block should have a toolbar with language label and copy button
- No "preserve" text should appear anywhere

✅ **Technical Terms Enhancement:**
- Technical terms outside code blocks should be wrapped in backticks
- Technical terms inside code blocks should remain unchanged
- No placeholder text should be visible

✅ **General Rendering:**
- All markdown syntax should render correctly
- No errors in the browser console
- Proper syntax highlighting for each language
