# Product Overview

Oxide Lab is a desktop AI chat application that runs large language models completely locally on the user's computer. It provides a private, subscription-free alternative to cloud-based AI services.

## Core Value Proposition

- **Privacy-first**: All computations happen locally, no data sent to external servers
- **Offline-capable**: Works without internet connection once models are downloaded
- **Performance-focused**: Built with Rust for speed and efficiency
- **User control**: Full control over model parameters and generation settings

## Target Users

- AI enthusiasts experimenting with local models
- Privacy-conscious users who want data sovereignty
- Researchers needing control over inference parameters
- Creative professionals using AI for writing and brainstorming

## Key Features

- Real-time streaming chat interface with markdown/code formatting
- "Thinking mode" that shows AI reasoning process before final answers
- Flexible inference parameters (temperature, top-k, top-p, min-p, repeat penalty)
- Support for Qwen3 models in GGUF format
- GPU acceleration via CUDA (optional, falls back to CPU)
- Model management with local scanning and remote browsing
- Chat history with session management

## Current Status

- Platform: Windows 10/11 (Linux/macOS planned)
- Model support: Qwen3 family in GGUF format
- Version: 0.13.0 (active development)
